                <h3>Welcome to my Portfoilo:</h3>
                <h3>Intro Bio:</h3>
                <p>My name is Matthew Walton, I'm a Web Developer. I've been playing around with computer since the late
                    80's as child. I've always been interested in computers and how they work and the science behind them.
                    I built my first computer and network system in the early 2000's at school, Gibson Technical School. Which was
                    a high school vocational school. During my time there I learned a little about everything that deals with computers.
                    About 2 years ago I started working at Amazon and it made me want to do better. So I decided to become a Web Developer.
                    I started out teaching myself how to code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also attended a cohort coding camp called Fullstack Academy.
                    Which I did not like because I felt like they were just confusinng us and their were some people who did get it at all.
                    Most of my coding knowledge comes from the self teaching platform called Solo Learn, FreeCodeCamp, and Google Developer.
                    I did learn some things from Fullstack Academy, like the basics of React, Redux, Node.js and some others I still need to learn so more about it.
                    I'm impressed with myself that, I've tough myself how to code and I've and I've also noticed that I"m a nature at it. I like learning new things and 
                    then showing them off. I'm a very creative person and I Like to create things. I'm continuesly learning new things and studying about Web and Mobile Development.
