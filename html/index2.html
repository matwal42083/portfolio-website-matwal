        <h4>What I'm all about:</h4>
           <p>I'm about Web and mobile Development to help create, innovate, integrated and revolutionize the future
            of mankind. I'm a very creative person and I like to think outside of the box, But I also understand 
            that you can't always think outside of the box, There are times you need to think inside the box.
            I'm a very hard worker and I'm always willing and wanting to learn new things or ideals. I have a innovator mind and 
            I'm consistently thinking of new ideals and ways to make things better, faster and more efficient. I've been thinking of more 
            ways where computers and software could better help mankind. I have a hard time shutting my brain off from thinking. I'm wanting 
            to learn more about learning mechines or AI systems one day, when I really master my skills. Im also want work as a Developer for companies 
            like Google, Uber, Lyft, Spotify, Walmart, Amazon and many more. I know for jobs like these, I need to be on top of my game and have the skills 
            I need to work for these compaines, So I am willing to go the distance that I need to work for these compaines. Not only am I looking for a job, but 
            I'm also looking for a job that I can benefit from and learn from to upskilled my skill set.</p>

            <h4>Matthew Walton education and knowledge:</h4>
            <p>Growing up as a child in the 80's, Playing around with computer's and being around computers at a very early age, has definitly been a advantage for me. I also would go on trips to seattle with my
              grandpa to check out the computer stores for new hardware and software that my grandpa was interested in. I would learn a lot, by listening to my
              grandpa and the store associate talk about computer's. I also learned from school as well, In 2000, I took a computer class at Gibson vocational Technical school.
              I took Computer Tech class and learn how to build my first computer and then we got to work on them all year long. We also build our own computer network system as well as 
              the computer lab that Gibson wanted. Our teacher also tough us how to code too. This was the first time that I ever coded and I fell in love with it. Then one day, I was showed 
              something about computers that turn me away from computer and its technology for a while, But nowdays I feel like a fool for turning my back on computers. In 2020 when I started 
              to work for Amazon, I decided to get back into the computer world again. I even went back to school for it. Before going back to school for it, I found a few learning platforms where I tough myself
              how to code. The learning platforms are great and I learn the most about Web and Mobile Development from the learning platforms verses the Code Camps Academy that I think are useless and will only
              confuse you more then what is needed, Plus the academy themselves didn't give us good learning or teaching materials. Most of all of my web and mobile development knowledge can from learn plateforms, like SoloLearn, freeCodeCamp,
             Google developer, and some of my react and terminal knowledge came from fullstack Academy</p>

              <h4>Computer products that I prefer:</h4>
              <p>I cannot stand Apple and their products. I don't like Apple computers, or Apple smart device. I strictly prefer PC and Samsung Galaxy. I think Apple is overated for what it is. The only 
                thing that apple has going for itself is it's OS and IOS. I don't like ASUS either, I think they build crappy computers parts and they are not a good choice for a computer. Mircosoft Windows is Okay, Mircosoft is a big company and they have a lot
                of computer products that are popular and that are pretty good. So learn and knowing Mircosoft is useful and handy to have around, but of course Mircosoft always makes things a little more diffcult. I love Google and all of their products.
                Google make everything on computers more better and easier. plus Google makes all of their product simple as well, while Mircosoft makes it too much at times, Not Google, they keep things 
                more simple. Linux products is another organization should I say, rather then a company, That I personal like as well. Linux, just like Google try to make things more easier for people. I like the fact That
                Linux is lightweight software that's actually a lot better then window's, That I've heard from others. I personal only have used the Ubuntu WSL terminal, Wich I like very much and I was thinking about upgrading to Window's 11 and Ubuntu WSL 2.0 version.
                From what I have read, The combination of Window's 11 and Ubuntu WSL 2.0 is supossed to be more integrated then what I got going, which is Window's 10 ubuntu WSL 1.0. </p>

                <h4>My Goals:</h4>
                <p>I have a project that I'm currently working on that is a React Application that involve's using Google Maps JavaScript API, Which I'm hoping to Develope more projects that use's Google Maps.
                   I really like Google Maps and is one of the greatest things that Google has created and have done. Over time, Google Maps will get better and better, but I wish Google would create more controls for the Navigation for better 
                   user experience. I also hope to learn more about AI systems and how to create them too. I have a Idea for a TV streaming platform that involves Cult classic movies and TV show's from certain decades that the user can choose and collect these 
                   movies and TV show's. There will be a section that's going to be called Cult Classic colltion, Where the user can download copy the movies and/or TV show's and to have as long as you like 
                   even if the movie is no longer on the plateform anymore. I like collecting movies, TV show, and Music. I collect music on Spotify, which is a another platform that I would like to working on.
