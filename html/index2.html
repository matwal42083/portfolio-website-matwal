                I'm a newer Fullstack Web developer that just graduated from school. Im a Skillful self-tought Web developer that has frontend and backend 
                skills. I started teaching myself how to code in 2021, because I made a decision to change careers and learned something new. I remembered that I 
                enjoyed coding the first time it was introduced to me in high school in my Vo-tech class in 2000. I was working at Amazon fulfillment center and I recieved a 
                text from Amazon offering schooling through their Career Choice program. I made the decision to take Web Development course, but before I committed myself to Web Development,
                I was even curious if I could even do it in the first place and if I could, Was I even able to learn it. So there was only one way to find out and that was to teach myself. I started to teach myself
                with determination.

                 <div class="goals">
                  <p>My goals are to learn as much as possible, and contiune to learn more. I'm intrested in learning several different computer languages 
                    and framework like Typescript, Angular, Vue, C# (C-Sharp), Java and more. I want to learn about learning machine and AI Systems. Currently my 
                    biggest goal is to get a job as a Web Developer or Software Engineer with a company that I can learn from and grow with as a Software Developer.
                    I'm very open to learning new things as well. I'm interested in learning more about Google JavaScript Maps API, Android Studio, Angular, Vue and React.
                    I have skills in React as well, but there is a lot more to learn about React.
