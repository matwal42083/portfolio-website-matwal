         <h3>Intro Bio:</h3>
          <p>My name is Matthew (matwal) Walton I was born and raised in Mt.Vernon Washington State. I'm a Web Developer who grew up in the 80's and 90's.
           At a early ago I was introduced to computers and video games by my grandpa, Who  was a computer enthusiast who also believed that computers would
           be the future of mankind. I remember my grandpa talking about how one day, Everybody will be walking around with a handel computers and interacting
           with computer programs in their every day living need's. I serious though that my grandpa was crazy for making that statement until I actually got to
           see one for the first time in my life. I was very amazed by my grandpa's prediction that he had made so many years ago, but my grandpa wasn't the only
           person whom I have heard made this statement before. I also heard this from other computer enthusiast that knew a lot about computers. I used to go on 
           these trips with my grandpa to Seattle to a lot of computer stores, where my grandpa would looking parts and software that he was interested in.All 
           throughout my elementary school years, Our teachers would teach us things about computers and how to use them. From Microsoft office tools all the
           way to how to send a emails, and when the internet became more popular.They also tough us thing about the internet as well. I have
           a lot of interested in science, technology, and engineering, mainly because I always wanted to know how certain things worked and why.</p>
           <p> I was in the Cub Scouts as a kid, growing up, which was very educational for me. Being in the Cub Scouts was 
           fun and we learned a lot of things involving science and engineering. I remember several times designing and building
           darby cars, another time I remember building a Rocket that wasn't really a toy either, and we got to shoot them off. We 
           also learned some forestry skills, survival skills, first-Aid skills and a lot more. I was also athlete in school, I played 
           football and baseball. I was really good at baseball and was MVP 2 years in a row. I lead my team and the league in batting
           average, homeruns, and RBI"S, Which made me a batting monster. Not only that, but I was also very fast at running the base's 
           and most of my homeruns were inside the field homeruns. In high school, I took a computer class at Gibson Vo-tech. Thats when
           I build my first computer, and we even did the network system for the whole school and also build a computer lab. I graduated
           high school May 17 2002 and spent a couple of years trying to figure out my life and what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.
           I lost interested with computers for a few years because of a stupid and silly decision and tried to stay away from it Which got me
           in the medical field and I became a CNA. I didn't really like being a CNA but I was good at it.</p>
           <p> I spent over 18 years in the medical field and then left it for good in 2021. In 2021, I started to work for Amazon and found that
           they will actually pay for your school education and either boost your skills or to better yourself. I decided to learn to become a web
           and mobile developer. The first thing I did, was to figure out if I could even code or have a interest in it. I knew that I had a somewhat
           of a interest, because back when I was a Gibson, We learned how to code a website and I actually like it back then. Then I found a tons of
           website and app for web and mobile development. Come to fine out that web and mobile development industry has a high demand that they literally
           have all kind of information on how to become a web and mobile developer. They have some much out there about the industry, that I was a able to
           teach myself a good deal of web and mobile development. I first started out coding on a app called Mimo and shortly later I changed to sololearn
           and freeCodeCamp. Both apps have tough me a great deal of web and mobile development, but more web then mobile. In 2022, I started attending code
           bootcamp called fullstack academy and they tough even more stuff about development. I recently took a interest in bitcoin and cryptocurrency and
           started to learn more about it, Because of the bitcoin ETF's, Bitcoin has hit new bullish highs and has recently gone up in value. I think it's very
           possible that bitcoin will eventually hit or get up too $100,000 dollars in the future. More and more people every day, every week, every month or
           year has started to invest in bitcoin and/or other crypto currencies. I do believe that bitcoin will have another big boom trend and a lot of people
           are going to get stupidly rich off of bitcoin again and the one's that was in when the first time bitcoin took off and got rich, that are still in it today are
           going to get even more rich of it. I'm not the type that's all about money, but it does bring some level of comfort for me, like natural. I'm not a
           greedy person, but I do like to have a little bit of money in my pockets or wallet. I'm a very simple person, I don't need a lot of things to make 
           me happy. So I've been teaching myself some technical analyst skills, to do some day trade on the side and been watching the crypto market. I'm saving
           my money in my coinbase account and continue to learn about it as a hobby. I have a son that is a quarterback for he's high school team and has the potientals
           of becoming a NFL quarterback and the next Tom Brady. I'm very proud of him. So far in my life I have worked in the resturant industry for about 5 years and have done every position in that industry, I've done nusring for about 18 years, which my last 6 years was at a children behavorial hospital during Pediatric Psych. When I was 18 years old, I also worked on the side in construction, like framing house, roofing, remodeling and stuff like that.
