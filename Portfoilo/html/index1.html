                <h3>Welcome to my Portfoilo:</h3>
                <h3>Intro Bio:</h3>
                <p>My name is Matthew (matwal) Walton, I'm a Web Developer who grew up in the late 80's and 90's in Washington. At a early ago I was introduced to computers by my grandpa, Who 
                  was a computer enthusiast who also believed that computers would be the future of mankind. I remember my grandpa talking about how one day, Everybody will have a computer
                  and that people will also be walking around with one in their pocket or being carrying around a hand handle computer. I serious though that my grandpa was crazy for making 
                  that statement until I actually got to see one for the first time in my life. I was very amazed by my grandpa's prdiction that he had made. I grew up around computers and I used to 
                  go on these trips with my grandpa to Seattle to a lot of computer stores, where my grandpa would looking parts and software that he was interested in. All throughtout my elementary school years, Our teachers
                  would teach us things about computers and how to use them. from Mircosoft office tools all the way to how to send a emails, and when the internet became more popular.They also tought us thing about the internet as well. I have
                  a lot of interested in science, technology, and engineering, mainly because I always wanted to know how certian things worked and why. I was in the Cub Scouts as a kid, growing up, which was very educational for me. Being in the Cub Scouts was 
                  fun and we learned a lot of things involving science and engineering. I remember several times designing and building durby cars, another time I remember building a Rocket that wasn't really a toy either, and 
                  we got to shoot them off. We also learned some forestry skills, surival skills, frist-Aid skills and a lot more. I was also athlete in school, I played football and baseball. I was really good at baseball and was MVP 2 years in a row. I 
                  lead my team and the league in batting average, homeruns, and RBI"S, Which made me a batting monster. Not only that, but I was also very fast at running the base's and most of my homeruns were inside the field homeruns. 
                  In high school, I took a computer class at Gibson Vo-tech. Thats when I build my first computer, and we even did the network system for the whole school and also build a computer lab.</p>
